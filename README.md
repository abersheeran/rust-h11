# h11

Inspired by [python-h11](https://github.com/python-hyper/h11).

It's a "bring-your-own-I/O" library; h11 contains no IO code whatsoever. This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network API, and that could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded, asynchronous, or your own implementation of [RFC 6214](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6214) -- h11 won't judge you.
